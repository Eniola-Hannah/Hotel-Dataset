# Data Cleaning and Querying

This project involves performing data cleaning and executing various SQL queries on the `Hotel_Dataset.csv` file. The task is divided into three major tasks:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Standardizing dates, renaming columns, correcting invalid entries, and verifying data types

2. **Basic SQL Queries**: Retrieving, filtering, and sorting data from the dataset. Using clauses like WHERE, LIKE, BETWEEN, and IN to filter records based on conditions

3. **Advanced SQL Operations**: Performing calculations, Combining multiple conditions using logical operators.
